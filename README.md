# itinerum-tripbreaker

This repository has been deprecated and moved to: https://githu.com/TRIP-Lab/itinerum-datakit/tree/master/datakit/process/trip_detection.

The `itinerum-datakit` repository is designed for quickly processing and viewing data, working on the algorithmic development there is the simpler choice than including this reposity as a submodule or having 3 duplicate versions of the code (all included in `itinerum-dashboard-api`).

Any new issues pertaining to the tripbreaker should also be moved to the `itinerum-datakit` repo.
